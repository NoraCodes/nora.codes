{{< div "intro-paragraph" >}}
I'm Leonora. You can call me Nora, if you like.

I'm a full time student in computer science at [Beloit](https://beloit.edu).

I build and break open source software for fun.

## 💼 Experience

**Software Engineering Intern**
{{< div "job-info" >}}
**CancerIQ, Inc. Summer 2018.**
I developed user interface components and designed algorithms used to analyze health data,
as well as working with DevOps technologies including Kubernetes, Apache Kafka, Prometheus,
and Grafana.

**Software Engineering Intern**
{{< div "job-info" >}}
**GudTech, Inc. Summer 2017.**
I used agile methodology to work with a small team, gaining experience with Go and the 
inner workings of Docker in a Service Oriented Architecture environment. I created a
developer tooling used for onboarding and external (SDK) development.

This is a selection of my experience. See my [full resume](/resume.pdf) for more,
including volunteer positions and college work experience.

## ⚖ Ethics
It is the duty of software engineers to build software in an ethical way. In short:

- computer systems should serve their users before their makers
- software should empower users, not restrict them
- users should decide how data is used before engineers or businesspeople

Whether it means embracing software freedom or another ideology, or going by gut feeling,
we must proceed as best we can.

## 🖥  Hardware

I occasionally build actual, physical stuff, mostly small RC aircraft and hacking kit.
Thanks to this hobby I have a good foundation in embedded programming with C and Wiring
(the Arduino programming language), as well as some exposure to hardware description
languages and FPGA programming.

I also really like [retro computing hardware](/post/the-sinclair-zx-81-ts-1000/), but
generally don't have the time or money to indulge this interest.

## 🎓 Tutorials
I've written tutorials on [type systems](/tutorial/a-gentle-introduction-to-practical-types/) and what can be done with them (for instance, [session types](/tutorial/session-types/).) 

If you're interested in x86 hacking, my [reverse engineering](/tutorial/an-intro-to-x86_64-reverse-engineering/) tutorial is a great place to start. For a more application-level security discussion, check out my post on [embedding malware in PDF files](/post/pdf-embedding-attacks/).

## 💬 Culture & Practices
The culture, business, and sociology of technology fascinate me.

I've written about topics ranging from [hacker superstitions](/post/hacker-superstitions/) and how spending way too much time customizing my desktop is [productive, actually](/post/modding-vim-i3-and-efficiency/) to [repairable hardware](/post/i-repaired-my-headphones/) and [free software](/post/open-source-for-normal-people/) and [why it matters](/post/a-story-about-my-personal-trainer/), for individuals and for [society](/post/deletefacebook-and-fosta/) as a whole.
